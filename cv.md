3. Personally for me, I would like to build something that is beneficial to the society. It may not be just one thing, but a combination of things. I have not exactly pin-pointed what I would like to make, but I guess that gives me the freedom to explore more technologies before settling on a problem and crafting a solution for it. As a student with still a lot to learn, that is my end goal, and it is what motivates me to improve myself as a developer.
